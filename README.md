# My lil cart  - first React project

Based on a exercise from The Ultimate React Course by Jonas Schmedtmann.

### Goals

- Better understanding the usage of state and derived state;
- Better understanding of props;
- Using dinstinct files for components, instead of write everything on App.js as in the exercise;
- More in general, trying to understand the best practices used in React (e.g. short circuiting).


#### Considerations on what I could do better next time:

- Coming from Vue.js, state management is *strange*. Not difficult, but I have to think twice before updating things.
- I played with short circuiting a liiitle too much, probably. What I wrote for changing the stats works perfectly, but I don't think it's the cleaniest code ever. Luckly, comments exist. 
- This is not responsive - not completely at least, and just for now. It doesn't crumble down in lower vw, but is not good. At least, I used some Grid!
