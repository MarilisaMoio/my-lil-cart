# My lil cart  - first React project

Based on a exercise from The Ultimate React Course by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann).
You can try it out [here](https://my-lil-cart.netlify.app)!

### Goals

- Better understanding the usage of state and derived state;
- Better understanding of props;
- Using dinstinct files for components, instead of write everything on App.js as in the exercise;
- More in general, trying to understand the best practices used in React (e.g. short circuiting).

#### Additions

- localStorage: now this lil cart is really usable in real life. Glad to know that it's not so different in React, and it gave me the possibility to check out useEffect too!


#### Considerations on what I could do better next time:

- Coming from Vue.js, state management is *strange*. Not difficult, but I have to think twice before updating things.
- I played with short circuiting a liiittle too much, probably. What I wrote for changing the stats works perfectly, but I don't think it's the cleaniest code ever. Luckly, comments exist. 
- This is not responsive - not completely at least, and just for now. It doesn't crumble down in lower vw, but is not good. At least, I used some Grid!
