# My lil cart  - first React project

Based on a exercise from The Ultimate React Course by Jonas Schmedtmann.

### Goals

- Better understanding the usage of state and derived state;
- Better understanding of props;
- Using dinstinct files for components, instead of write everything on App.js as in the exercise;
- More in general, trying to understand the best practices used in React (e.g. short circuiting).
